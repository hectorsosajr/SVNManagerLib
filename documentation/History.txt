      file was created then read immediately afterwards.

       correctly.

0.4.9 - Feb 13, 2007

UPDATE - Changed the DumpArgs struct. Removed all of the boolean values
      since I realized that they were not needed. This also means, that

      that a correctly formed revision range is passed in.
UPDATE - Finished the Repository Dump functionality.

0.4.8 - Feb 10, 2007
