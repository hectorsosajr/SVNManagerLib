SVNManagerLib History

0.5.1 - June 11, 2007

FIX - Exception when an empty svnmanagerlib.ini 
      file was created then read immediately afterwards.

0.5.0 - June 7, 2007

      that write to disk.

       correctly.

0.4.9 - Feb 13, 2007

UPDATE - Changed the DumpArgs struct. Removed all of the boolean values
      since I realized that they were not needed. This also means, that
      the code is not doing validation for correct ranges. It assumes
      that a correctly formed revision range is passed in.
UPDATE - Finished the Repository Dump functionality.

0.4.8 - Feb 10, 2007
